Fake Social Media Profile detection and reporting

## Description
In today's digital age, online social networks have fundamentally transformed the way we engage in social interactions. Connecting with friends, staying updated on their lives, and forming new connections has never been more accessible. However, the rapid proliferation of these platforms has given rise to a concerning issue â€“ the prevalence of fake profiles and online impersonation.

The convenience of online social networks comes hand in hand with challenges such as the spread of fake profiles, often used for spamming legitimate users with inappropriate or even illegal content. Recognizing the signs of a fake social media profile is crucial in safeguarding one's online presence. Businesses, in particular, need to be vigilant, as these fake profiles can pose a threat to their reputation and security.

Being able to identify and address fake social media profiles is an essential skill in navigating the online landscape responsibly. It not only ensures a safer and more authentic online experience but also contributes to maintaining the integrity of social networks for genuine users.
